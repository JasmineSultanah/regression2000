# regression2000

Overview of our regression [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/central_london_data_science/events/249149833/):

---

We wanted to use our historic our meetup membership numbers, and the timing of our meetups to see if we can predict future meetup attendance using linear regreesion.

In the pyton directory are 2 notebooks: 

1. meetup_regression_notebook.ipynb - this details the basics to linear regression, and introduces how we can implement lasso and ridge regression. 
2. 05.06-Linear-Regression.ipynb - this is a direct chapter taken from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
